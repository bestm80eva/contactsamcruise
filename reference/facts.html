The play area is 42 character squares high, but only the middle 38 (y-coordinates 2-39) are ever displayed. Which means that the top two rows (y-coordinates 0 and 1) of the play area are always hidden - even though the graphic data for them exists and is not garbage.

The gangster who hangs around at no. 15 in game mode 1 (waiting for Sam to enter without a key) and the gangster who watches for Sam outside the police station in game modes 2 and 3 are different in one significant respect from the other gangsters in the game: after the gangster has dropped Sam off the roof of no. 19, he is immediately teleported back to his base location (see <a class="link" href="../asm/24925.html">24925</a>), thus foiling any plans Sam might have to sneak past the police station or into no. 15 while the gangster is on his return journey.

This check is redundant - there is no other kind of object that Sam could land on - but was it always so? Perhaps at some stage during the development of the game, non-banknote objects may have been seen blowing along the streets. And perhaps those non-banknote objects were bits of garbage. There is, after all, a line in the game instructions that says "A gust of wind disturbs the garbage on the sidewalk".

The unused routine at <a class="link" href="../asm/61618.html">61618</a> is found in the table of keypress handling routines at <a class="link" href="../asm/60672.html">60672</a>, but is not bound to any key - so what does it do? Perhaps during development it <em>was</em> bound to some key, and was used to quit the game and return to BASIC. Note also the unused routine at <a class="link" href="../asm/61612.html">61612</a>, which sets the operand of the 'LD SP' instruction in the routine at 61618, sets up the bottom 4 lines of the screen, and then starts the game in demo mode; could it be the tail end of a routine that was used during development to start the game for testing?

Pressing 'H' while Sam is on the phone makes him hang up. No message is displayed to confirm that event, but the unused message at <a class="link" href="../asm/27113.html">27113</a> (I HUNG UP) indicates that there probably used to be. That unused message is used by the unused routine at <a class="link" href="../asm/31284.html">31284</a>, which queues the message urgently and plays a sound effect. Perhaps this feature was removed before the game was released because pressing 'H' while reading a phone message would make the message fly by too quickly, making it difficult to take in.

Now enter no. 31 (POKE <a class="link" href="../asm/32746.html">32746</a>,16 gives Sam the key to that house), go up to the roof, and walk off the edge - Sam will land on the gangster's head and knock him out. Move a few steps to the left, wait for the gangster to recover and return to the knockout location, and do it all over again.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Note that because of a <a class="link" href="bugs.html#pttd">bug</a> in the routine that controls a character who's been knocked over, the gangster may, after recovering, freeze in a location that is to the left of the knockout location. In that case, Sam won't land on his head by jumping off the roof of no. 31. However, after Sam has landed on the sidewalk (and recovered from the fall), the gangster will remain frozen, completely unaware of Sam a few steps behind him.

<div><a name="snipersAndKeys"></a></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">Snipers and keys</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The probability that a sniper will appear at any moment depends partly on how many keys Sam has collected - the more keys, the more likely it is that a sniper will rear his head and start shooting (see <a class="link" href="../asm/25307.html">25307</a>).
</div>
</div>
<div><a name="bulletSpeed"></a></div>

As Sam gets more money, the snipers' bullets fly faster through the air (see <a class="link" href="../asm/26075.html">26075</a>).
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The bullets are slowest when Sam has less than $256; they are bit faster when Sam has between $256 and $511; they are a bit faster still when Sam has between $512 and $767; and they are fastest when Sam has between $768 and $1023 (twice as fast as when Sam has less than $256, in fact).
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The good news is that should Sam be lucky enough to get past the $1023 barrier - a difficult task given that the sum total of the cash available in the game, not including banknotes, is only $950 ($550 in bonuses plus $100 for each of the four keys) - the bullets return to their slowest speed.

<div><a name="stunSettings"></a></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">Stun settings</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Exactly where Sam hits a character by falling onto his head determines how long that character will stay down and stagger afterwards before recovering. If Sam's x-coordinate matches the character's x-coordinate at the time of collision, the stricken character will stay down for twice as long and subsequently stagger around for twice as long as when the x-coordinates differ by 1 (see <a class="link" href="../asm/64162.html">64162</a> and <a class="link" href="../asm/64005.html">64005</a>).

<div class="box-title">Deck me if you can</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The routine at <a class="link" href="../asm/64162.html">64162</a> checks whether anyone (including Sam) has been struck by a falling character, but because it simply places the address of the uninterruptible subcommand routine at <a class="link" href="../asm/64005.html">64005</a> or <a class="link" href="../asm/64005.html#64009">64009</a> into bytes 18 and 19 of the stricken character's buffer, this has no effect on Sam; thus Sam is the only character who cannot be knocked over by another character landing on his head.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Note that the only occasion on which a character other than Sam will step off the roof of a building (and therefore possibly strike another character) is when that character is chasing Sam, and Sam has just stepped off the right edge of the roof of the apartment building next to no. 19 onto the roof of no. 19: the chasing character will jump down onto the roof of no. 19 too.

<div><a name="gangstersAndDisguises"></a></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">Gangsters and disguises</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The gangsters at no. 19 will allow Sam to enter their house and roam freely inside if he uses disguise no. 7 (the oil man):
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<img alt="disguise7" src="../images/udgs/disguise7.png" />
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
This disguise enables Sam to pick up the ringing phone on the top floor of no. 19; if he answers it as ED (press 'E' when asked who's there), a voice says 'OK ED - THE FAT MAN HAS THE KEY TO NO 27'. The disguise doesn't fool the gangsters for ever, though: after Sam has crossed the roof of no. 19 using the hook (and someone below says 'CRUISE WAS DRESSED AS THE OIL MAN. DONT LET ANYONE PAST'), the disguise becomes useless (see <a class="link" href="../asm/64836.html">64836</a>).
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Unfortunately, none of the other gangsters are ever fooled by any of Sam's disguises.

<div><a name="policemenAndDisguises"></a></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Policemen and disguises</div>
<div class="paragraph">
If Sam is being chased by the police, the best strategy for making a getaway is to wait until the chasing policeman is almost close enough to arrest him, and then quickly don a disguise that is not yet known to the police. This will give Sam a chance to scoot past the officer without being picked up, which is useful if you're just not quite ready to go to jail yet.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
However, as soon as Sam has been seen in disguise by either policeman, it is only a matter of time before that disguise becomes known to both officers, and Sam will be on the run again. Also note that it's a bad idea to hang around after changing disguise: when a disguise becomes known to the police, any policeman who has already seen Sam in that disguise will return to where he first saw him (see <a class="link" href="../asm/29559.html">29559</a>).

Contrary to popular belief - and perhaps her employment contract as well - Daisy doesn't spend all her time pacing up and down in Sam's office waiting for telephone calls. In fact, every so often she leaves the office and wanders over to the right-hand green room on the top floor of the apartment building next to no. 19 (see <a class="link" href="../asm/65076.html">65076</a>). What possible business could she have there? Even worse, during demo mode, Daisy walks up and down on the roof of the apartment building next to no. 19 for ever (see <a class="link" href="../asm/57888.html">57888</a>). Strange behaviour for a secretary, to be sure.

But could these ordinary special locations have been used, at some time during the development of the game, to trigger a special location handler routine that actually did something interesting? One thing that the locations have in common (except perhaps for the ones at no. 74) is that they each mark the entrance to a room: an apartment, the room past the catwalk, Sam's office (for example). Maybe these locations triggered a handler routine that made the character switch on the lights before entering the room? That is one possibility, but we may never know for sure.

The two cats in the game use a simple two-phase animation sequence (animatory states <a class="link" href="../graphics/as.html#118">118</a> and <a class="link" href="../graphics/as.html#117">117</a>) in which the tail is always pointing upwards at an angle:

But sprite tiles 215 and 216 (which are unused) also look like the body and tail of a cat - this time with the tail pointing horizontally - and may once have been used as an alternative second phase (or additional phase) of animation for that creature:
